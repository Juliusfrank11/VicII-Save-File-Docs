# VicII-Save-File-Docs
## Documentation for the Victoria II Save File structure

This documentation is being done as part of the [OpenVic](https://github.com/OpenVicProject/OpenVic), but can be used independently.

Documentation is stored in `save_docs.md`. 

Any save ***unmodded*** VicII save files can be added to `saves/` to help with documentation. The python script `make_tabbed_saves.py` can help put the save files in a more read able tab-based format for documentation.
